# `data/` folder

In this folder there will be all the data, order in subfolder according to `scripts/` steps.

Note that this folder is ignore by git (in the `.gitignore` file), as data files are big and we don't want to pollute our git history with it.
Still if you have not-too-big data files that you want to include, you can add them with `git add -f my_data_file1`.
